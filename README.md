# AI-Powered Story Crafter

A Generative AI application that creates imaginative short stories based on user-provided prompts. Built using Hugging Faceâ€™s `dolly-v2-3b` transformer model and run entirely in Google Colab, this tool showcases the creative potential of open-source LLMs in storytelling.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Summary

This project was developed as part of the IBM Generative AI Internship. It uses an open LLM (Dolly v2-3b) to generate creative stories around 200â€“300 words long. The model responds to unique prompts and returns vivid, character-rich narratives â€” no API keys or paid services required.

## âœ¨ Features

- Prompt-based story generation
- Fully offline, runs in Google Colab
- Uses Hugging Face Transformers (`databricks/dolly-v2-3b`)
